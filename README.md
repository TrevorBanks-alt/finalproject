###The game that I am creating is Pac Man that has randomly generated mazes. You need Pac man because it is a controlable character that the player uses to interact with the game, you need the maze that is randomly generated to create a challenge for the player, you need ghosts to have an enemy in the game which makes the game harder and more enjoyable, and you need pellets which are the scoring system in pac man which increases the score of the player which gives them motivation to play the game.
