# Final Project

## I am considering making a verson of pac man that generates a random maze pattern every time. The primary group members would be pac man who obviously is the character used to play the game, the maze that will be randomly generated, the little pelets that pac man uses to increase the score, and the ghosts that chace pac man to get a game over.
